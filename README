    All about HTMLPurifier

HTMLPurifier is an HTML filtering solution.  It uses a unique combination of
robust whitelists and agressive parsing to ensure that not only are XSS
attacks thwarted, but the resulting HTML is standards compliant.

See INSTALL on how to use the library.  See docs/ for more developer-oriented
documentation as well as some code examples.  Users of TinyMCE or FCKeditor
may be especially interested in WYSIWYG.

HTMLPurifier can be found on the web at: http://hp.jpsband.org/
