= KEY ====================
    # Flagship
    - Regular
    ? Maybe I'll Do It
==========================

1.7 release [Advanced API]
 # Complete advanced API, and fully document it
 # Implement all edge-case attribute transforms
 # Implement all deprecated tags and attributes
 - Parse TinyMCE-style whitelist into our %HTML.Allow* whitelists (possibly
   do this earlier)

1.8 release [Refactor, refactor!]
 # URI validation routines tighter (see docs/dev-code-quality.html) (COMPLEX)
 # Advanced URI filtering schemes (see docs/proposal-new-directives.txt)
 - Configuration profiles: predefined directives set with one func call
 - Implement IDREF support (harder than it seems, since you cannot have
   IDREFs to non-existent IDs)
 - Allow non-ASCII characters in font names

1.9 release [Error'ed]
 # Error logging for filtering/cleanup procedures
    - Requires I18N facilities to be created first (COMPLEX)
 - XSS-attempt detection
 - More fine-grained control over escaping behavior
    - Silently drop content inbetween SCRIPT tags (can be generalized to allow
      specification of elements that, when detected as foreign, trigger removal
      of children, although unbalanced tags could wreck havoc (or at least
      delete the rest of the document)).

1.10 release [Do What I Mean, Not What I Say]
 # Additional support for poorly written HTML
    - Microsoft Word HTML cleaning (i.e. MsoNormal, but research essential!)
    - Friendly strict handling of <address> (block -> <br>)
 - Remove redundant tags, ex. <u><u>Underlined</u></u>. Implementation notes:
    1. Analyzing which tags to remove duplicants
    2. Ensure attributes are merged into the parent tag
    3. Extend the tag exclusion system to specify whether or not the
    contents should be dropped or not (currently, there's code that could do
    something like this if it didn't drop the inner text too.)
 - Remove <span> tags that don't do anything (no attributes)
 - Remove empty inline tags<i></i>
 - Append something to duplicate IDs so they're still usable (impl. note: the
   dupe detector would also need to detect the suffix as well)

2.0 release [Beyond HTML]
 # Legit token based CSS parsing (will require revamping almost every
   AttrDef class)
 # Formatters for plaintext (COMPLEX)
    - Auto-paragraphing (be sure to leverage fact that we know when things
      shouldn't be paragraphed, such as lists and tables).
    - Linkify URLs
    - Smileys
    - Linkification for HTML Purifier docs: notably configuration and classes
 - Allow tags to be "armored", an internal flag that protects them
   from validation and passes them out unharmed
 - Fixes for Firefox's inability to handle COL alignment props (Bug 915)
 - Automatically add non-breaking spaces to empty table cells when
   empty-cells:show is applied to have compatibility with Internet Explorer
 - Convert RTL/LTR override characters to <bdo> tags, or vice versa on demand.
   Also, enable disabling of directionality

3.0 release [To XML and Beyond]
 - Extended HTML capabilities based on namespacing and tag transforms (COMPLEX)
    - Hooks for adding custom processors to custom namespaced tags and
      attributes, offer default implementation
    - Lots of documentation and samples
 - XHTML 1.1 support

Ongoing
 - Lots of profiling, make it faster!
 - Plugins for major CMSes (COMPLEX)
    - WordPress (mostly written, needs beta-testing)
    - eFiction
    - more! (look for ones that use WYSIWYGs)

Unknown release (on a scratch-an-itch basis)
 ? Semi-lossy dumb alternate character encoding transfor
 ? Have 'lang' attribute be checked against official lists, achieved by
   encoding all characters that have string entity equivalents

Requested
 ? Native content compression, whitespace stripping (don't rely on Tidy, make
   sure we don't remove from <pre> or related tags)

Wontfix
 - Non-lossy smart alternate character encoding transformations (unless
   patch provided)
 - Pretty-printing HTML, users can use Tidy on the output on entire page
