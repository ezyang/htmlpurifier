    # Breaks back-compat
    ! Feature
    - Bugfix
      + Sub-comment
    . Internal change
==========================

4.9.2, released 2017-03-12
- Fixes PHP 5.3 compatibility
- Fix breakage when decoding decimal entities.  Thanks @rybakit (#129)

4.9.1, released 2017-03-08
! %URI.DefaultScheme can now be set to null, in which case
  all relative paths are removed.
! New CSS properties: min-width, max-width, min-height, max-height (#94)
! Transparency (rgba) and hsl/hsla supported where color CSS is present.
  Thanks @fxbt for contributing the patch. (#118)
- When idn_to_ascii is defined, we might accept malformed
  hostnames.  Apply validation to the result in such cases.
- Close directory when done in Serializer DefinitionCache (#100)
- Deleted some asserts to avoid linters from choking (#97)
- Rework Serializer cache behavior to avoid chmod'ing if possible (#32)
- Embedded semicolons in strings in CSS are now handled correctly!
- We accidentally dropped certain Unicode characters if there was
  one or more invalid characters.  This has been fixed, thanks
  to mpyw <ryosuke_i_628@yahoo.co.jp>
- Fix for "Don't truncate upon encountering </div> when using DOMLex"
  caused a regression with HTML 4.01 Strict parsing with libxml 2.9.1
  (and maybe later versions, but known OK with libxml 2.9.4).  The
  fix is to go about handling truncation a bit more cleverly so that
  we can wrap with divs (sidestepping the bug) but slurping out the
  rest of the text in case it ran off the end.  (#78)
- Fix PREG_BACKTRACK_LIMIT_ERROR in HTMLPurifier_Filter_ExtractStyle.
  Thanks @breathbath for contributing the report and fix (#120)
- Fix entity decoding algorithm to be more conservative about
  decoding entities that are missing trailing semicolon.
  To get old behavior, set %Core.LegacyEntityDecoder to true.
  (#119)
- Workaround libxml bug when HTML tags are embedded inside
  script tags.  To disable workaround set %Core.AggressivelyRemoveScript
  to false. (#83)
# By default, when a link has a target attribute associated
  with it, we now also add rel="noopener" in order to
  prevent the new window from being able to overwrite
  the original frame.  To disable this protection,
  set %HTML.TargetNoopener to FALSE.

4.9.0 was cut on Git but never properly released; when we did the
real release we decided to skip this version number.

4.8.0, released 2016-07-16
# By default, when a link has a target attribute associated
  with it, we now also add rel="noreferrer" in order to
  prevent the new window from being able to overwrite
  the original frame.  To disable this protection,
  set %HTML.TargetNoreferrer to FALSE.
! Full PHP 7 compatibility, the test suite is ALL GO.
! %CSS.AllowDuplicates permits duplicate CSS properties.
! Support for 'tel' URIs.
! Partial support for 'border-radius' properties when %CSS.AllowProprietary is true.
  The slash syntax, i.e., 'border-radius: 2em 1em 4em / 0.5em 3em' is not
  yet supported.
! %Attr.ID.HTML5 turns on HTML5-style ID handling.
- alt truncation could result in malformed UTF-8 sequence. Don't
  truncate.  Thanks Brandon Farber for reporting.
- Linkify regex is smarter, based off of Gruber's regex.
- IDNA supported natively on PHP 5.3 and later.
- Non all-numeric top-level names (e.g., foo.1f, 1f) are now
  allowed.
- Minor bounds error fix to squash a PHP 7 notice.
- Support non-/tmp temporary directories for data:// validation
- Give a better error message when a user attempts to allow
  ul/ol without allowing li.
- On some versions of PHP, the Serializer DefinitionCache could
  infinite loop when the directory exists but is not listable. (#49)
- Don't match for <body> inside comments with
  %Core.ConvertDocumentToFragment. (#67)
- SafeObject is now less case sensitive. (#57)
- AutoFormat.RemoveEmpty.Predicate now correctly renders in
  web form. (#85)

4.7.0, released 2015-08-04
# opacity is now considered a "tricky" CSS property rather than a
  proprietary one.
! %AutoFormat.RemoveEmpty.Predicate for specifying exactly when
  an element should be considered "empty" (maybe preserve if it
  has attributes), and modify iframe support so that the iframe
  is removed if it is missing a src attribute.  Thanks meeva for
  reporting.
- Don't truncate upon encountering </div> when using DOMLex.  Thanks
  Myrto Christina for finally convincing me to fix this.
- Update YouTube filter for new code.
- Fix parsing of rgb() values with spaces in them for 'border'
  attribute.
- Don't remove foo="" attributes if foo is a boolean attribute.  Thanks
  valME for reporting.

4.6.0, released 2013-11-30
# Secure URI munge hashing algorithm has changed to hash_hmac("sha256", $url, $secret).
  Please update any verification scripts you may have.
# URI parsing algorithm was made more strict, so only prefixes which
  looks like schemes will actually be schemes.  Thanks
  Michael Gusev <mgusev@sugarcrm.com> for fixing.
# %Core.EscapeInvalidChildren is no longer supported, and no longer does
  anything.
! New directive %Core.AllowHostnameUnderscore which allows underscores
  in hostnames.
- Eliminate quadratic behavior in DOMLex by using a proper queue.
  Thanks Ole Laursen for noticing this.
- Rewritten MakeWellFormed/FixNesting implementation eliminates quadratic
  behavior in the rest of the purificaiton pipeline.  Thanks Chedburn
  Networks for sponsoring this work.
- Made Linkify URL parser a bit less permissive, so that non-breaking
  spaces and commas are not included as part of URL.  Thanks nAS for fixing.
- Fix some bad interactions with %HTML.Allowed and injectors.  Thanks
  David Hirtz for reporting.
- Fix infinite loop in DirectLex. Thanks Ashar Javed (@soaj1664ashar)
  for reporting.

4.5.0, released 2013-02-17
# Fix bug where stacked attribute transforms clobber each other;
  this also means it's no longer possible to override attribute
  transforms in later modules.  No internal code was using this
  but this may break some clients.
# We now use SHA-1 to identify cached definitions, instead of MD5.
! Support display:inline-block
! Support for more white-space CSS values.
! Permit underscores in font families
! Support for page-break-* CSS3 properties when proprietary properties
  are enabled.
! New directive %Core.DisableExcludes; can be set to 'true' to turn off
  SGML excludes checking.  If HTML Purifier is removing too much text
  and you don't care about full standards compliance, try setting this to
  'true'.
- Use prepend for SPL autoloading on PHP 5.3 and later.
- Fix bug with nofollow transform when pre-existing rel exists.
- Fix bug where background:url() always gets lower-cased
  (but not background-image:url())
- Fix bug with non lower-case color names in HTML
- Fix bug where data URI validation doesn't remove temporary files.
  Thanks Javier Marín Ros <javiermarinros@gmail.com> for reporting.
- Don't remove certain empty tags on RemoveEmpty.

4.4.0, released 2012-01-18
# Removed PEARSax3 handler.
# URI.Munge now munges URIs inside the same host that go from https
  to http.  Reported by Neike Taika-Tessaro.
# Core.EscapeNonASCIICharacters now always transforms entities to
  entities, even if target encoding is UTF-8.
# Tighten up selector validation in ExtractStyleBlocks.
  Non-syntactically valid selectors are now rejected, along with
  some of the more obscure ones such as attribute selectors, the
  :lang pseudoselector, and anything not in CSS2.1.  Furthermore,
  ID and class selectors now work properly with the relevant
  configuration attributes.  Also, mute errors when parsing CSS
  with CSS Tidy.  Reported by Mario Heiderich and Norman Hippert.
! Added support for 'scope' attribute on tables.
! Added %HTML.TargetBlank, which adds target="blank" to all outgoing links.
! Properly handle sub-lists directly nested inside of lists in
  a standards compliant way, by moving them into the preceding <li>
! Added %HTML.AllowedComments and %HTML.AllowedCommentsRegexp for
  limited allowed comments in untrusted situations.
! Implement iframes, and allow them to be used in untrusted mode with
  %HTML.SafeIframe and %URI.SafeIframeRegexp.  Thanks Bradley M. Froehle
  <brad.froehle@gmail.com> for submitting an initial version of the patch.
! The Forms module now works properly for transitional doctypes.
! Added support for internationalized domain names. You need the PEAR
  Net_IDNA2 module to be in your path; if it is installed, ensure the
  class can be loaded and then set %Core.EnableIDNA to true.
- Color keywords are now case insensitive.  Thanks Yzmir Ramirez
  <yramirez-htmlpurifier@adicio.com> for reporting.
- Explicitly initialize anonModule variable to null.
- Do not duplicate nofollow if already present.  Thanks 178
  for reporting.
- Do not add nofollow if hostname matches our current host.  Thanks 178
  for reporting, and Neike Taika-Tessaro for helping diagnose.
- Do not unset parser variable; this fixes intermittent serialization
  problems.  Thanks Neike Taika-Tessaro for reporting, bill
  <10010tiger@gmail.com> for diagnosing.
- Fix iconv truncation bug, where non-UTF-8 target encodings see
  output truncated after around 8000 characters.  Thanks Jörg Ludwig
  <joerg.ludwig@iserv.eu> for reporting.
- Fix broken table content model for XHTML1.1 (and also earlier
  versions, although the W3C validator doesn't catch those violations).
  Thanks GlitchMr <glitch.mr@gmail.com> for reporting.

4.3.0, released 2011-03-27
# Fixed broken caching of customized raw definitions, but requires an
  API change.  The old API still works but will emit a warning,
  see http://htmlpurifier.org/docs/enduser-customize.html#optimized
  for how to upgrade your code.
# Protect against Internet Explorer innerHTML behavior by specially
  treating attributes with backticks but no angled brackets, quotes or
  spaces.  This constitutes a slight semantic change, which can be
  reverted using %Output.FixInnerHTML.  Reported by Neike Taika-Tessaro
  and Mario Heiderich.
# Protect against cssText/innerHTML by restricting allowed characters
  used in fonts further than mandated by the specification and encoding
  some extra special characters in URLs.  Reported by Neike
  Taika-Tessaro and Mario Heiderich.
! Added %HTML.Nofollow to add rel="nofollow" to external links.
! More types of SPL autoloaders allowed on later versions of PHP.
! Implementations for position, top, left, right, bottom, z-index
  when %CSS.Trusted is on.
! Add %Cache.SerializerPermissions option for custom serializer
  directory/file permissions
! Fix longstanding bug in Flash support for non-IE browsers, and
  allow more wmode attributes.
! Add %CSS.AllowedFonts to restrict permissible font names.
- Switch to an iterative traversal of the DOM, which prevents us
  from running out of stack space for deeply nested documents.
  Thanks Maxim Krizhanovsky for contributing a patch.
- Make removal of conditional IE comments ungreedy; thanks Bernd
  for reporting.
- Escape CDATA before removing Internet Explorer comments.
- Fix removal of id attributes under certain conditions by ensuring
  armor attributes are preserved when recreating tags.
- Check if schema.ser was corrupted.
- Check if zend.ze1_compatibility_mode is on, and error out if it is.
  This safety check is only done for HTMLPurifier.auto.php; if you
  are using standalone or the specialized includes files, you're
  expected to know what you're doing.
- Stop repeatedly writing the cache file after I'm done customizing a
  raw definition.  Reported by ajh.
- Switch to using require_once in the Bootstrap to work around bad
  interaction with Zend Debugger and APC.  Reported by Antonio Parraga.
- Fix URI handling when hostname is missing but scheme is present.
  Reported by Neike Taika-Tessaro.
- Fix missing numeric entities on DirectLex; thanks Neike Taika-Tessaro
  for reporting.
- Fix harmless notice from indexing into empty string.  Thanks Matthijs
  Kooijman <matthijs@stdin.nl> for reporting.
- Don't autoclose no parent elements are able to support the element
  that triggered the autoclose.  In particular fixes strange behavior
  of stray <li> tags.  Thanks pkuliga@gmail.com for reporting and
  Neike Taika-Tessaro <pinkgothic@gmail.com> for debugging assistance.

4.2.0, released 2010-09-15
! Added %Core.RemoveProcessingInstructions, which lets you remove
  <? ... ?> statements.
! Added %URI.DisableResources functionality; the directive originally
  did nothing.  Thanks David Rothstein for reporting.
! Add documentation about configuration directive types.
! Add %CSS.ForbiddenProperties configuration directive.
! Add %HTML.FlashAllowFullScreen to permit embedded Flash objects
  to utilize full-screen mode.
! Add optional support for the <code>file</code> URI scheme, enable
  by explicitly setting %URI.AllowedSchemes.
! Add %Core.NormalizeNewlines options to allow turning off newline
  normalization.
- Fix improper handling of Internet Explorer conditional comments
  by parser.  Thanks zmonteca for reporting.
- Fix missing attributes bug when running on Mac Snow Leopard and APC.
  Thanks sidepodcast for the fix.
- Warn if an element is allowed, but an attribute it requires is
  not allowed.

4.1.1, released 2010-05-31
- Fix undefined index warnings in maintenance scripts.
- Fix bug in DirectLex for parsing elements with a single attribute
  with entities.
- Rewrite CSS output logic for font-family and url().  Thanks Mario
  Heiderich <mario.heiderich@googlemail.com> for reporting and Takeshi
  Terada <t-terada@violet.plala.or.jp> for suggesting the fix.
- Emit an error for CollectErrors if a body is extracted
- Fix bug where in background-position for center keyword handling.
- Fix infinite loop when a wrapper element is inserted in a context
  where it's not allowed.  Thanks Lars <lars@renoz.dk> for reporting.
- Remove +x bit and shebang from index.php; only supported mode is to
  explicitly call it with php.
- Make test script less chatty when log_errors is on.

4.1.0, released 2010-04-26
! Support proprietary height attribute on table element
! Support YouTube slideshows that contain /cp/ in their URL.
! Support for data: URI scheme; not enabled by default, add it using
  %URI.AllowedSchemes
! Support flashvars when using %HTML.SafeObject and %HTML.SafeEmbed.
! Support for Internet Explorer compatibility with %HTML.SafeObject
  using %Output.FlashCompat.
! Handle <ol><ol> properly, by inserting the necessary <li> tag.
- Always quote the insides of url(...) in CSS.

4.0.0, released 2009-07-07
# APIs for ConfigSchema subsystem have substantially changed. See
  docs/dev-config-bcbreaks.txt for details; in essence, anything that
  had both namespace and directive now have a single unified key.
# Some configuration directives were renamed, specifically:
    %AutoFormatParam.PurifierLinkifyDocURL -> %AutoFormat.PurifierLinkify.DocURL
    %FilterParam.ExtractStyleBlocksEscaping -> %Filter.ExtractStyleBlocks.Escaping
    %FilterParam.ExtractStyleBlocksScope -> %Filter.ExtractStyleBlocks.Scope
    %FilterParam.ExtractStyleBlocksTidyImpl -> %Filter.ExtractStyleBlocks.TidyImpl
  As usual, the old directive names will still work, but will throw E_NOTICE
  errors.
# The allowed values for class have been relaxed to allow all of CDATA for
  doctypes that are not XHTML 1.1 or XHTML 2.0.  For old behavior, set
  %Attr.ClassUseCDATA to false.
# Instead of appending the content model to an old content model, a blank
  element will replace the old content model.  You can use #SUPER to get
  the old content model.
! More robust support for name="" and id=""
! HTMLPurifier_Config::inherit($config) allows you to inherit one
  configuration, and have changes to that configuration be propagated
  to all of its children.
! Implement %HTML.Attr.Name.UseCDATA, which relaxes validation rules on
  the name attribute when set. Use with care. Thanks Ian Cook for
  sponsoring.
! Implement %AutoFormat.RemoveEmpty.RemoveNbsp, which removes empty
  tags that contain non-breaking spaces as well other whitespace. You
  can also modify which tags should have &nbsp; maintained with
  %AutoFormat.RemoveEmpty.RemoveNbsp.Exceptions.
! Implement %Attr.AllowedClasses, which allows administrators to restrict
  classes users can use to a specified finite set of classes, and
  %Attr.ForbiddenClasses, which is the logical inverse.
! You can now maintain your own configuration schema directories by
  creating a config-schema.php file or passing an extra argument. Check
  docs/dev-config-schema.html for more details.
! Added HTMLPurifier_Config->serialize() method, which lets you save away
  your configuration in a compact serial file, which you can unserialize
  and use directly without having to go through the overhead of setup.
- Fix bug where URIDefinition would not get cleared if it's directives got
  changed.
- Fix fatal error in HTMLPurifier_Encoder on certain platforms (probably NetBSD 5.0)
- Fix bug in Linkify autoformatter involving <a><span>http://foo</span></a>
- Make %URI.Munge not apply to links that have the same host as your host.
- Prevent stray </body> tag from truncating output, if a second </body>
  is present.
. Created script maintenance/rename-config.php for renaming a configuration
  directive while maintaining its alias.  This script does not change source code.
. Implement namespace locking for definition construction, to prevent
  bugs where a directive is used for definition construction but is not
  used to construct the cache hash.

3.3.0, released 2009-02-16
! Implement CSS property 'overflow' when %CSS.AllowTricky is true.
! Implement generic property list classess
- Fix bug with testEncodingSupportsASCII() algorithm when iconv() implementation
  does not do the "right thing" with characters not supported in the output
  set.
- Spellcheck UTF-8: The Secret To Character Encoding
- Fix improper removal of the contents of elements with only whitespace. Thanks
  Eric Wald for reporting.
- Fix broken test suite in versions of PHP without spl_autoload_register()
- Fix degenerate case with YouTube filter involving double hyphens.
  Thanks Pierre Attar for reporting.
- Fix YouTube rendering problem on certain versions of Firefox.
- Fix CSSDefinition Printer problems with decorators
- Add text parameter to unit tests, forces text output
. Add verbose mode to command line test runner, use (--verbose)
. Turn on unit tests for UnitConverter
. Fix missing version number in configuration %Attr.DefaultImageAlt (added 3.2.0)
. Fix newline errors that caused spurious failures when CRLF HTML Purifier was
  tested on Linux.
. Removed trailing whitespace from all text files, see
  remote-trailing-whitespace.php maintenance script.
. Convert configuration to use property list backend.

3.2.0, released 2008-10-31
# Using %Core.CollectErrors forces line number/column tracking on, whereas
  previously you could theoretically turn it off.
# HTMLPurifier_Injector->notifyEnd() is formally deprecated. Please
  use handleEnd() instead.
! %Output.AttrSort for when you need your attributes in alphabetical order to
  deal with a bug in FCKEditor. Requested by frank farmer.
! Enable HTML comments when %HTML.Trusted is on. Requested by Waldo Jaquith.
! Proper support for name attribute. It is now allowed and equivalent to the id
  attribute in a and img tags, and is only converted to id when %HTML.TidyLevel
  is heavy (for all doctypes).
! %AutoFormat.RemoveEmpty to remove some empty tags from documents. Please don't
  use on hand-written HTML.
! Add error-cases for unsupported elements in MakeWellFormed. This enables
  the strategy to be used, standalone, on untrusted input.
! %Core.AggressivelyFixLt is on by default. This causes more sensible
  processing of left angled brackets in smileys and other whatnot.
! Test scripts now have a 'type' parameter, which lets you say 'htmlpurifier',
  'phpt', 'vtest', etc. in order to only execute those tests. This supercedes
  the --only-phpt parameter, although for backwards-compatibility the flag
  will still work.
! AutoParagraph auto-formatter will now preserve double-newlines upon output.
  Users who are not performing inbound filtering, this may seem a little
  useless, but as a bonus, the test suite and handling of edge cases is also
  improved.
! Experimental implementation of forms for %HTML.Trusted
! Track column numbers when maintain line numbers is on
! Proprietary 'background' attribute on table-related elements converted into
  corresponding CSS.  Thanks Fusemail for sponsoring this feature!
! Add forward(), forwardUntilEndToken(), backward() and current() to Injector
  supertype.
! HTMLPurifier_Injector->handleEnd() permits modification to end tokens. The
  time of operation varies slightly from notifyEnd() as *all* end tokens are
  processed by the injector before they are subject to the well-formedness rules.
! %Attr.DefaultImageAlt allows overriding default behavior of setting alt to
  basename of image when not present.
! %AutoFormat.DisplayLinkURI neuters <a> tags into plain text URLs.
- Fix two bugs in %URI.MakeAbsolute; one involving empty paths in base URLs,
  the other involving an undefined $is_folder error.
- Throw error when %Core.Encoding is set to a spurious value. Previously,
  this errored silently and returned false.
- Redirected stderr to stdout for flush error output.
- %URI.DisableExternal will now use the host in %URI.Base if %URI.Host is not
  available.
- Do not re-munge URL if the output URL has the same host as the input URL.
  Requested by Chris.
- Fix error in documentation regarding %Filter.ExtractStyleBlocks
- Prevent <![CDATA[<body></body>]]> from triggering %Core.ConvertDocumentToFragment
- Fix bug with inline elements in blockquotes conflicting with strict doctype
- Detect if HTML support is disabled for DOM by checking for loadHTML() method.
- Fix bug where dots and double-dots in absolute URLs without hostname were
  not collapsed by URIFilter_MakeAbsolute.
- Fix bug with anonymous modules operating on SafeEmbed or SafeObject elements
  by reordering their addition.
- Will now throw exception on many error conditions during lexer creation; also
  throw an exception when MaintainLineNumbers is true, but a non-tracksLineNumbers
  is being used.
- Detect if domxml extension is loaded, and use DirectLEx accordingly.
- Improve handling of big numbers with floating point arithmetic in UnitConverter.
  Reported by David Morton.
. Strategy_MakeWellFormed now operates in-place, saving memory and allowing
  for more interesting filter-backtracking
. New HTMLPurifier_Injector->rewind() functionality, allows injectors to rewind
  index to reprocess tokens.
. StringHashParser now allows for multiline sections with "empty" content;
  previously the section would remain undefined.
. Added --quick option to multitest.php, which tests only the most recent
  release for each series.
. Added --distro option to multitest.php, which accepts either 'normal' or
  'standalone'. This supercedes --exclude-normal and --exclude-standalone

3.1.1, released 2008-06-19
# %URI.Munge now, by default, does not munge resources (for example, <img src="">)
  In order to enable this again, please set %URI.MungeResources to true.
! More robust imagecrash protection with height/width CSS with %CSS.MaxImgLength,
  and height/width HTML with %HTML.MaxImgLength.
! %URI.MungeSecretKey for secure URI munging. Thanks Chris
  for sponsoring this feature. Check out the corresponding documentation
  for details. (Att Nightly testers: The API for this feature changed before
  the general release. Namely, rename your directives %URI.SecureMungeSecretKey =>
  %URI.MungeSecretKey and and %URI.SecureMunge => %URI.Munge)
! Implemented post URI filtering. Set member variable $post to true to set
  a URIFilter as such.
! Allow modules to define injectors via $info_injector. Injectors are
  automatically disabled if injector's needed elements are not found.
! Support for "safe" objects added, use %HTML.SafeObject and %HTML.SafeEmbed.
  Thanks Chris for sponsoring. If you've been using ad hoc code from the
  forums, PLEASE use this instead.
! Added substitutions for %e, %n, %a and %p in %URI.Munge (in order,
  embedded, tag name, attribute name, CSS property name). See %URI.Munge
  for more details. Requested by Jochem Blok.
- Disable percent height/width attributes for img.
- AttrValidator operations are now atomic; updates to attributes are not
  manifest in token until end of operations. This prevents naughty internal
  code from directly modifying CurrentToken when they're not supposed to.
  This semantics change was requested by frank farmer.
- Percent encoding checks enabled for URI query and fragment
- Fix stray backslashes in font-family; CSS Unicode character escapes are
  now properly resolved (although *only* in font-family). Thanks Takeshi Terada
  for reporting.
- Improve parseCDATA algorithm to take into account newline normalization
- Account for browser confusion between Yen character and backslash in
  Shift_JIS encoding. This fix generalizes to any other encoding which is not
  a strict superset of printable ASCII. Thanks Takeshi Terada for reporting.
- Fix missing configuration parameter in Generator calls. Thanks vs for the
  partial patch.
- Improved adherence to Unicode by checking for non-character codepoints.
  Thanks Geoffrey Sneddon for reporting. This may result in degraded
  performance for extremely large inputs.
- Allow CSS property-value pair ''text-decoration: none''. Thanks Jochem Blok
  for reporting.
. Added HTMLPurifier_UnitConverter and HTMLPurifier_Length for convenient
  handling of CSS-style lengths. HTMLPurifier_AttrDef_CSS_Length now uses
  this class.
. API of HTMLPurifier_AttrDef_CSS_Length changed from __construct($disable_negative)
  to __construct($min, $max). __construct(true) is equivalent to
  __construct('0').
. Added HTMLPurifier_AttrDef_Switch class
. Rename HTMLPurifier_HTMLModule_Tidy->construct() to setup() and bubble method
  up inheritance hierarchy to HTMLPurifier_HTMLModule. All HTMLModules
  get this called with the configuration object.  All modules now
  use this rather than __construct(), although legacy code using constructors
  will still work--the new format, however, lets modules access the
  configuration object for HTML namespace dependant tweaks.
. AttrDef_HTML_Pixels now takes a single construction parameter, pixels.
. ConfigSchema data-structure heavily optimized; on average it uses a third
  the memory it did previously. The interface has changed accordingly,
  consult changes to HTMLPurifier_Config for details.
. Variable parsing types now are magic integers instead of strings
. Added benchmark for ConfigSchema
. HTMLPurifier_Generator requires $config and $context parameters. If you
  don't know what they should be, use HTMLPurifier_Config::createDefault()
  and new HTMLPurifier_Context().
. Printers now properly distinguish between output configuration, and
  target configuration. This is not applicable to scripts using
  the Printers for HTML Purifier related tasks.
. HTML/CSS Printers must be primed with prepareGenerator($gen_config), otherwise
  fatal errors will ensue.
. URIFilter->prepare can return false in order to abort loading of the filter
. Factory for AttrDef_URI implemented, URI#embedded to indicate URI that embeds
  an external resource.
. %URI.Munge functionality factored out into a post-filter class.
. Added CurrentCSSProperty context variable during CSS validation

3.1.0, released 2008-05-18
# Unnecessary references to objects (vestiges of PHP4) removed from method
  signatures.  The following methods do not need references when assigning from
  them and will result in E_STRICT errors if you try:
    + HTMLPurifier_Config->get*Definition() [* = HTML, CSS]
    + HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema::instance()
    + HTMLPurifier_DefinitionCacheFactory::instance()
    + HTMLPurifier_DefinitionCacheFactory->create()
    + HTMLPurifier_DoctypeRegistry->register()
    + HTMLPurifier_DoctypeRegistry->get()
    + HTMLPurifier_HTMLModule->addElement()
    + HTMLPurifier_HTMLModule->addBlankElement()
    + HTMLPurifier_LanguageFactory::instance()
# Printer_ConfigForm's get*() functions were static-ified
# %HTML.ForbiddenAttributes requires attribute declarations to be in the
  form of tag@attr, NOT tag.attr (which will throw an error and won't do
  anything). This is for forwards compatibility with XML; you'd do best
  to migrate an %HTML.AllowedAttributes directives to this syntax too.
! Allow index to be false for config from form creation
! Added HTMLPurifier::VERSION constant
! Commas, not dashes, used for serializer IDs. This change is forwards-compatible
  and allows for version numbers like "3.1.0-dev".
! %HTML.Allowed deals gracefully with whitespace anywhere, anytime!
! HTML Purifier's URI handling is a lot more robust, with much stricter
  validation checks and better percent encoding handling. Thanks Gareth Heyes
  for indicating security vulnerabilities from lax percent encoding.
! Bootstrap autoloader deals more robustly with classes that don't exist,
  preventing class_exists($class, true) from barfing.
- InterchangeBuilder now alphabetizes its lists
- Validation error in configdoc output fixed
- Iconv and other encoding errors muted even with custom error handlers that
  do not honor error_reporting
- Add protection against imagecrash attack with CSS height/width
- HTMLPurifier::instance() created for consistency, is equivalent to getInstance()
- Fixed and revamped broken ConfigForm smoketest
- Bug with bool/null fields in Printer_ConfigForm fixed
- Bug with global forbidden attributes fixed
- Improved error messages for allowed and forbidden HTML elements and attributes
- Missing (or null) in configdoc documentation restored

3.1.0rc1, released 2008-04-22
# Autoload support added. Internal require_once's removed in favor of an
  explicit require list or autoloading. To use HTML Purifier,
  you must now either use HTMLPurifier.auto.php
  or HTMLPurifier.includes.php; setting the include path and including
  HTMLPurifier.php is insufficient--in such cases include HTMLPurifier.autoload.php
  as well to register our autoload handler (or modify your autoload function
  to check HTMLPurifier_Bootstrap::getPath($class)). You can also use
  HTMLPurifier.safe-includes.php for a less performance friendly but more
  user-friendly library load.
# HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema static functions are officially deprecated. Schema
  information is stored in the ConfigSchema directory, and the
  maintenance/generate-schema-cache.php generates the schema.ser file, which
  is now instantiated. Support for userland schema changes coming soon!
# HTMLPurifier_Config will now throw E_USER_NOTICE when you use a directive
  alias; to get rid of these errors just modify your configuration to use
  the new directive name.
# HTMLPurifier->addFilter is deprecated; built-in filters can now be
  enabled using %Filter.$filter_name or by setting your own filters using
  %Filter.Custom
# Directive-level safety properties superceded in favor of module-level
  safety. Internal method HTMLModule->addElement() has changed, although
  the externally visible HTMLDefinition->addElement has *not* changed.
! Extra utility classes for testing and non-library operations can
  be found in extras/. Specifically, these are FSTools and ConfigDoc.
  You may find a use for these in your own project, but right now they
  are highly experimental and volatile.
! Integration with PHPT allows for automated smoketests
! Limited support for proprietary HTML elements, namely <marquee>, sponsored
  by Chris. You can enable them with %HTML.Proprietary if your client
  demands them.
! Support for !important CSS cascade modifier. By default, this will be stripped
  from CSS, but you can enable it using %CSS.AllowImportant
! Support for display and visibility CSS properties added, set %CSS.AllowTricky
  to true to use them.
! HTML Purifier now has its own Exception hierarchy under HTMLPurifier_Exception.
  Developer error (not enduser error) can cause these to be triggered.
! Experimental kses() wrapper introduced with HTMLPurifier.kses.php
! Finally %CSS.AllowedProperties for tweaking allowed CSS properties without
  mucking around with HTMLPurifier_CSSDefinition
! ConfigDoc output has been enhanced with version and deprecation info.
! %HTML.ForbiddenAttributes and %HTML.ForbiddenElements implemented.
- Autoclose now operates iteratively, i.e. <span><span><div> now has
  both span tags closed.
- Various HTMLPurifier_Config convenience functions now accept another parameter
  $schema which defines what HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema to use besides the
  global default.
- Fix bug with trusted script handling in libxml versions later than 2.6.28.
- Fix bug in ExtractStyleBlocks with comments in style tags
- Fix bug in comment parsing for DirectLex

. tests/index.php can now be run from any directory.
. HTMLPurifier_Token subclasses split into seperate files
. HTMLPURIFIER_PREFIX now is defined in Bootstrap.php, NOT HTMLPurifier.php
. HTMLPURIFIER_PREFIX can now be defined outside of HTML Purifier
. New --php=php flag added, allows PHP executable to be specified (command
  line only!)
. htmlpurifier_add_test() preferred method to translate test files in to
  classes, because it handles PHPT files too.
. Debugger class is deprecated and will be removed soon.
. Command line argument parsing for testing scripts revamped, now --opt value
  format is supported.
. Smoketests now cleanup after magic quotes
. Generator now can output comments (however, comments are still stripped
  from HTML Purifier output)
. HTMLPurifier_ConfigSchema->validate() deprecated in favor of
  HTMLPurifier_VarParser->parse()

  documents and cleaning their contents up. Requires the CSSTidy library
  <http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/>. You can access the blocks with the
  'StyleBlocks' Context variable ($purifier->context->get('StyleBlocks')).
  The output CSS can also be "scoped" for a specific element, use:
  %Filter.ExtractStyleBlocksScope

  opacity (and all of the browser-specific equivalents) and scrollbar colors.
  Enable by setting %CSS.Proprietary to true.

- Fatal error when <img> tag (or any other element with required attributes)
  has 'id' attribute fixed, thanks NykO18 for reporting
- Fix warning emitted when a non-supported URI scheme is passed to the
  MakeAbsolute URIFilter, thanks NykO18 (again)
- Further refine AutoParagraph injector. Behavior inside of elements

  fixed (does not manifest on default tag-set)
- Spurious internal content reorganization error suppressed
- HTMLDefinition->addElement now returns a reference to the created
  element object, as implied by the documentation

  by Nate Abele
- Work around unnecessary DOMElement type-cast in PH5P that caused errors
  in PHP 5.1

  HTMLDefinition errors, this may indicate problems with error-collecting
  facilities in PHP 5
- Make ErrorCollectorEMock work in both PHP 4 and PHP 5
- Make PH5P work with PHP 5.0 by removing unnecessary array parameter typedef
. %Core.AcceptFullDocuments renamed to %Core.ConvertDocumentToFragment
  to better communicate its purpose

  are actively testing

2.1.2, released 2007-09-03
! Implemented Object module for trusted users
! Implemented experimental HTML5 parsing mode using PH5P. To use, add
  this to your code:
        require_once 'HTMLPurifier/Lexer/PH5P.php';
        $config->set('Core', 'LexerImpl', 'PH5P');
  Note that this Lexer introduces some classes not in the HTMLPurifier
  namespace.  Also, this is PHP5 only.
! CSS property border-spacing implemented
- Fix non-visible parsing error in DirectLex with empty tags that have
  slashes inside attribute values.
- Fix typo in CSS definition: border-collapse:seperate; was incorrectly
  accepted as valid CSS. Usually non-visible, because this styling is the
  default for tables in most browsers. Thanks Brett Zamir for pointing
  this out.
- Fix validation errors in configuration form
- Hammer out a bunch of edge-case bugs in the standalone distribution
- Inclusion reflection removed from URISchemeRegistry; you must manually
  include any new schema files you wish to use

  PHP4 compatibility

2.1.1, released 2007-08-04
- Fix show-stopper bug in %URI.MakeAbsolute functionality

  other installations from clobbering the standalone's URI schemes
. Single test methods can be invoked by prefixing with __only

2.1.0, released 2007-08-02
# flush-htmldefinition-cache.php superseded in favor of a generic
  flush-definition-cache.php script, you can clear a specific cache
  by passing its name as a parameter to the script
! Phorum mod implemented for HTML Purifier
! With %Core.AggressivelyFixLt, <3 and similar emoticons no longer
  trigger HTML removal in PHP5 (DOMLex). This directive is not necessary
  for PHP4 (DirectLex).

  includes (although there are still a few files that reside in the
  standalone folder)
! Relative URIs can now be transformed into their absolute equivalents
  using %URI.Base and %URI.MakeAbsolute

  longer strings that would be more appropriately edited with a textarea
. Allow newlines to act as separators for lists, hashes, lookups and
  %HTML.Allowed
. ConfigForm generates textareas instead of text inputs for lists, hashes,
  lookups, text and itext fields
. Hidden element content removal genericized: %Core.HiddenElements can
  be used to customize this behavior, by default <script> and <style> are
  hidden
. Added HTMLPURIFIER_PREFIX constant, should be used instead of dirname(__FILE__)
. Custom ChildDef added to default include list
. URIScheme reflection improved: will not attempt to include file if class
  already exists. May clobber autoload, so I need to keep an eye on it
. ConfigSchema heavily optimized, will only collect information and validate
  definitions when HTMLPURIFIER_SCHEMA_STRICT is true.
. AttrDef_URI unit tests and implementation refactored
. benchmarks/ directory now protected from public view with .htaccess file;
  run the tests via command line
. URI scheme is munged off if there is no authority and the scheme is the
  default one
. All unit tests inherit from HTMLPurifier_Harness, not UnitTestCase
. Interface for URIScheme changed
. Generic URI object to hold components of URI added, most systems involved
  in URI validation have been migrated to use it
. Custom filtering for URIs factored out to URIDefinition interface for
  maximum extensibility

2.0.1, released 2007-06-27
! Tag auto-closing now based on a ChildDef heuristic rather than a
  manually set auto_close array; some behavior may change
! Experimental AutoFormat functionality added: auto-paragraph and
  linkify your HTML input by setting %AutoFormat.AutoParagraph and
  %AutoFormat.Linkify to true
! Newlines normalized internally, and then converted back to the
  value of PHP_EOL. If this is not desired, set your newline format
  using %Output.Newline.

  cases involving Lexing or Strategies
- Clean up special case code for <script> tags
- Reorder includes for DefinitionCache decorators, fixes a possible
  missing class error

  others when revision numbers are unequal
- Improve Serializer DefinitionCache directory permissions checks
- DefinitionCache no longer throws errors when it encounters old
  serial files that do not conform to the current style

  much easier selective embedding of configuration values
. Doctype objects now accept public and system DTD identifiers
. %HTML.Doctype is now constrained by specific values, to specify a custom
  doctype use new %HTML.CustomDoctype
. ConfigForm truncates long directives to keep the form small, and does
  not re-output namespaces

2.0.0, released 2007-06-20
# Completely refactored HTMLModuleManager, decentralizing safety
  information
# Transform modules changed to Tidy modules, which offer more flexibility
  and better modularization
# Configuration object now finalizes itself when a read operation is
  performed on it, ensuring that its internal state stays consistent.
  To revert this behavior, you can set the $autoFinalize member variable
  off, but it's not recommended.
# New compact syntax for AttrDef objects that can be used to instantiate
  new objects via make()
# Definitions (esp. HTMLDefinition) are now cached for a significant
  performance boost. You can disable caching by setting %Core.DefinitionCache
  to null. You CANNOT edit raw definitions without setting the corresponding
  DefinitionID directive (%HTML.DefinitionID for HTMLDefinition).
# Contents between <script> tags are now completely removed if <script>
  is not allowed
# Prototype-declarations for Lexer removed in favor of configuration
  determination of Lexer implementations.
