    # Breaks back-compat
    ! Feature
    - Bugfix
      + Sub-comment
    . Internal change
==========================

2.1.1, released 2007-08-04
- Fix show-stopper bug in %URI.MakeAbsolute functionality
- Fix PHP4 syntax error in standalone version
. Add prefix directory to include path for standalone, this prevents
  other installations from clobbering the standalone's URI schemes
. Single test methods can be invoked by prefixing with __only

2.1.0, released 2007-08-02
# flush-htmldefinition-cache.php superseded in favor of a generic
  flush-definition-cache.php script, you can clear a specific cache
  by passing its name as a parameter to the script
! Phorum mod implemented for HTML Purifier
! With %Core.AggressivelyFixLt, <3 and similar emoticons no longer
  trigger HTML removal in PHP5 (DOMLex). This directive is not necessary
  for PHP4 (DirectLex).
! Standalone file now available, which greatly reduces the amount of
  includes (although there are still a few files that reside in the
  standalone folder)
! Relative URIs can now be transformed into their absolute equivalents
  using %URI.Base and %URI.MakeAbsolute
! Ruby implemented for XHTML 1.1
! You can now define custom URI filtering behavior, see enduser-uri-filter.html
  for more details
! UTF-8 font names now supported in CSS
- AutoFormatters emit friendly error messages if tags or attributes they
  need are not allowed
- ConfigForm's compactification of directive names is now configurable
- AutoParagraph autoformatter algorithm refined after field-testing
- XHTML 1.1 now applies XHTML 1.0 Strict cleanup routines, namely
  blockquote wrapping
- Contents of <style> tags removed by default when tags are removed
. HTMLPurifier_Config->getSerial() implemented, this is extremely useful
  for output cache invalidation
. ConfigForm printer now can retrieve CSS and JS files as strings, in
  case HTML Purifier's directory is not publically accessible
. Introduce new text/itext configuration directive values: these represent
  longer strings that would be more appropriately edited with a textarea
. Allow newlines to act as separators for lists, hashes, lookups and
  %HTML.Allowed
. ConfigForm generates textareas instead of text inputs for lists, hashes,
  lookups, text and itext fields
. Hidden element content removal genericized: %Core.HiddenElements can
  be used to customize this behavior, by default <script> and <style> are
  hidden
. Added HTMLPURIFIER_PREFIX constant, should be used instead of dirname(__FILE__)
. Custom ChildDef added to default include list
. URIScheme reflection improved: will not attempt to include file if class
  already exists. May clobber autoload, so I need to keep an eye on it
. ConfigSchema heavily optimized, will only collect information and validate
  definitions when HTMLPURIFIER_SCHEMA_STRICT is true.
. AttrDef_URI unit tests and implementation refactored
. benchmarks/ directory now protected from public view with .htaccess file;
  run the tests via command line
. URI scheme is munged off if there is no authority and the scheme is the
  default one
. All unit tests inherit from HTMLPurifier_Harness, not UnitTestCase
. Interface for URIScheme changed
. Generic URI object to hold components of URI added, most systems involved
  in URI validation have been migrated to use it
. Custom filtering for URIs factored out to URIDefinition interface for
  maximum extensibility

2.0.1, released 2007-06-27
! Tag auto-closing now based on a ChildDef heuristic rather than a
  manually set auto_close array; some behavior may change
! Experimental AutoFormat functionality added: auto-paragraph and
  linkify your HTML input by setting %AutoFormat.AutoParagraph and
  %AutoFormat.Linkify to true
! Newlines normalized internally, and then converted back to the
  value of PHP_EOL. If this is not desired, set your newline format
  using %Output.Newline.
! Beta error collection, messages are implemented for the most generic
  cases involving Lexing or Strategies
- Clean up special case code for <script> tags
- Reorder includes for DefinitionCache decorators, fixes a possible
  missing class error
- Fixed bug where manually modified definitions were not saved via cache
  (mostly harmless, except for the fact that it would be a little slower)
- Configuration objects with different serials do not clobber each
  others when revision numbers are unequal
- Improve Serializer DefinitionCache directory permissions checks
- DefinitionCache no longer throws errors when it encounters old
  serial files that do not conform to the current style
- Stray xmlns attributes removed from configuration documentation
- configForm.php smoketest no longer has XSS vulnerability due to
  unescaped print_r output
- Printer adheres to configuration's directives on output format
- Fix improperly named form field in ConfigForm printer
. Rewire some test-cases to swallow errors rather than expect them
. HTMLDefinition printer updated with some of the new attributes
. DefinitionCache keys reordered to reflect precedence: version number,
  hash, then revision number
. %Core.DefinitionCache renamed to %Cache.DefinitionImpl
. Interlinking in configuration documentation added using
  Injector_PurifierLinkify
. Directives now keep track of aliases to themselves
. Error collector now requires a severity to be passed, use PHP's internal
  error constants for this
. HTMLPurifier_Config::getAllowedDirectivesForForm implemented, allows
  much easier selective embedding of configuration values
. Doctype objects now accept public and system DTD identifiers
. %HTML.Doctype is now constrained by specific values, to specify a custom
  doctype use new %HTML.CustomDoctype
. ConfigForm truncates long directives to keep the form small, and does
  not re-output namespaces

2.0.0, released 2007-06-20
# Completely refactored HTMLModuleManager, decentralizing safety
  information
# Transform modules changed to Tidy modules, which offer more flexibility
  and better modularization
# Configuration object now finalizes itself when a read operation is
  performed on it, ensuring that its internal state stays consistent.
  To revert this behavior, you can set the $autoFinalize member variable 
  off, but it's not recommended.
# New compact syntax for AttrDef objects that can be used to instantiate
  new objects via make()
# Definitions (esp. HTMLDefinition) are now cached for a significant
  performance boost. You can disable caching by setting %Core.DefinitionCache
  to null. You CANNOT edit raw definitions without setting the corresponding
  DefinitionID directive (%HTML.DefinitionID for HTMLDefinition).
# Contents between <script> tags are now completely removed if <script>
  is not allowed
# Prototype-declarations for Lexer removed in favor of configuration
  determination of Lexer implementations.
! HTML Purifier now works in PHP 4.3.2.

! Implement TinyMCE styled whitelist specification format in
  %HTML.Allowed

  and attributes (addAttribute) on HTMLDefinition
! Add native support for required attributes
- Deprecated and removed EnableRedundantUTF8Cleaning. It didn't even work!
- DOMLex will not emit errors when a custom error handler that does not
  honor error_reporting is used
- StrictBlockquote child definition refrains from wrapping whitespace
  in tags now.
- Bug resulting from tag transforms to non-allowed elements fixed

  false positives
. Unit test for ElementDef created, ElementDef behavior modified to
  be more flexible
. Added convenience functions for HTMLModule constructors
. AttrTypes now has accessor functions that should be used instead
  of directly manipulating info
. TagTransform_Center deprecated in favor of generic TagTransform_Simple
. Add extra protection in AttrDef_URI against phantom Schemes
. Doctype object added to HTMLDefinition which describes certain aspects
  of the operational document type
. Lexer is now pre-emptively included, with a conditional include for the
  PHP5 only version.

  + hspace and vspace in img
  + size and noshade in hr
  + nowrap in td
  + clear in br
  + align in caption, table, img and hr
  + type in ul, ol and li
! DirectLex now preserves text in which a < bracket is followed by
  a non-alphanumeric character. This means that certain emoticons
  are now preserved.
! %Core.RemoveInvalidImg is now operational, when set to false invalid
  images will hang around with an empty src
! target attribute in a tag supported, use %Attr.AllowedFrameTargets
  to enable
! CSS property white-space now allows nowrap (supported in all modern
  browsers) but not others (which have spotty browser implementations)
! XHTML 1.1 mode now sort-of works without any fatal errors, and
  lang is now moved over to xml:lang.
! Attribute transformation smoketest available at smoketests/attrTransform.php
! Transformation of font's size attribute now handles super-large numbers
- Possibly fatal bug with __autoload() fixed in module manager
- Invert HTMLModuleManager->addModule() processing order to check
  prefixes first and then the literal module
- Empty strings get converted to empty arrays instead of arrays with
  an empty string in them.
- Merging in attribute lists now works.
. Demo script removed: it has been added to the website's repository
. Basic.php script modified to work out of the box
. Refactor AttrTransform classes to reduce duplication
. AttrTransform_TextAlign axed in favor of a more general
  AttrTransform_EnumToCSS, refer to HTMLModule/TransformToStrict.php to
  see how the new equivalent is implemented
. Unit tests now use exclusively assertIdentical
 
1.6.0, released 2007-04-01
! Support for most common deprecated attributes via transformations:
  + bgcolor in td, th, tr and table
  + border in img
  + name in a and img
  + width in td, th and hr

- You can define ID blacklists using regular expressions via
  %Attr.IDBlacklistRegexp
- Error messages are emitted when you attempt to "allow" elements or
  attributes that HTML Purifier does not support


- Fix segfault in unit test. The problem is not very reproduceable and
  I don't know what causes it, but a six line patch fixed it.

1.5.0, released 2007-03-23
! Added a rudimentary I18N and L10N system modeled off MediaWiki. It
  doesn't actually do anything yet, but keep your eyes peeled.
! docs/enduser-utf8.html explains how to use UTF-8 and HTML Purifier
! Newly structured HTMLDefinition modeled off of XHTML 1.1 modules.
  I am loathe to release beta quality APIs, but this is exactly that;
  don't use the internal interfaces if you're not willing to do migration
  later on.

- Fixed buggy chameleon-support for ins and del
. Added support for IDREF attributes (i.e. for)
. Renamed HTMLPurifier_AttrDef_Class to HTMLPurifier_AttrDef_Nmtokens
. Removed context variable ParentType, replaced with IsInline, which
  is false when you're not inline and an integer of the parent that
  caused you to become inline when you are (so possibly zero)
. Removed ElementDef->type in favor of ElementDef->descendants_are_inline
  and HTMLDefinition->content_sets
. StrictBlockquote now reports what elements its supposed to allow,
  rather than what it does allow
. Removed HTMLDefinition->info_flow_elements in favor of
  HTMLDefinition->content_sets['Flow']
. Removed redundant "exclusionary" definitions from DTD roster
. StrictBlockquote now requires a construction parameter as if it
  were an Required ChildDef, this is the "real" set of allowed elements
. AttrDef partitioned into HTML, CSS and URI segments
. Modify Youtube filter regexp to be multiline
. Require both PHP5 and DOM extension in order to use DOMLex, fixes
  some edge cases where a DOMDocument class exists in a PHP4 environment
  due to DOM XML extension.
